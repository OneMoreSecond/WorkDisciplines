# WorkDisciplines

Laws as condensed work experience

## Why we need it

There are always many things to consider in work.
Without written disciplines, it's easy to miss some points.

In written disciplines, you can also include your reflections which help you avoid previous mistakes.

## Principles

### Force

Every work item should follow disciplines in corresponding areas.

### Complete

Disciplines should cover all considerations in that area.

### Develop

If there is something missed, add it.

If there is something wrong, correct it.
